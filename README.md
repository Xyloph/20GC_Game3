# Frogger, but hand drawn

Game 3 of the challenge. Decided to make all the art with paper and a pencil, 
took photos and put them in. I think it gives an original style. I have not 
implemented everything that should be in there, it'll be missing the crocodiles 
and the lanes aren't exactly what they should've been. But that's ok.
